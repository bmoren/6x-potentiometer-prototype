# 6x-potentiometer-prototype
6 potentiometers broken out into a stand alone board for prototyping.

REV2 is best produced with OSHPPARK's Aftferdark Service.

### Each potentiometer is wired up the following:
+ Pin 1: Ground (AGND)
+ Pin 2: accessible via pin socket
+ Pin 3: + (vcc / 3.3v / 5v)

Each potentiometer's analog signal is accessible via the 1-6 pins corresponding to the potentiometer L->R     
GND & voltage inputs available in each pins bank. 

See the [schematic](schematic.pdf) for more details.

### Recommended Potentiometers:
+ Alpha vertical 9mm ([thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/alpha-9mm-pots-dshaft/)) ([modular addict](https://modularaddict.com/parts/potentiometers-3/9mm-dshaft-vertical-potentiometers))
+ 9mm Tall trimmers ([thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/product-category/parts/pot/9mm/9mm-trimmer-pots/)) ([modular addict](https://modularaddict.com/parts/potentiometers-3/9mm-tall-trimmer-potentiometers))

For modular prototyping I suggest using 4x B10K & 2X A10k for linear and logarithmic taper options.

### Recomended jumpers:
+ Square tipped jumpers ([adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1957))

### Recomended Pins:
8x 2.54mm Vertical Pin headers for female/female jumper cables 
8x 2.54mm Vertical Pin sockets for male/male jumper cables
8x 2.54mm Angled Pin headers to keep the potentiometers as free from cable interference as possible

### Rubber feet
might be nice?
